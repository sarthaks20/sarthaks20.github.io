Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a [Civil Engineering](https://civil.iitd.ac.in/) graduate from the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). My research interests lie in structural engineering, computational mechanics, finite element analysis, peridynamics, structural health monitoring, machine learning, and modeling and simulation.

THE WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<!-- During my time at IIT Delhi, I have worked on several research projects that have helped me develop my skills and knowledge in the field of civil engineering. In addition to my research work, I also have experience in competitive programming and possess technical skills in programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, Julia, and software and tools such as Microsoft Office, Visual Studio Code, STAAD.Pro, Abaqus FEA, and MATLAB.

I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies and methodologies in my field. In the future, I plan to pursue higher studies and specialize in computational structural mechanics. I am confident that my skills, coupled with my dedication and hard work, will enable me to excel in my chosen field and make valuable contributions to the scientific community. -->
